## Summary
<!-- With many years of *self-taught* coding experience in various languages, this is my first formal mentorship program with assignment applications.  I spent the better part of two days writing most of the styling and functionality, then another day to develop the 24-hour format option.  It was a valuable learning experience;  I was able to connect and understand on a deeper level, several logical concepts that I've known for a while, but didn't fully understand. -->
